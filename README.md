# Vocab Teacher

A work in progress.


## DDD spaced repition vocabulary application.

The app will provide a spaced repition learning interface for the user, a highly automated card generation feature for the administrator.
It will require login and have stripe payment method.

## Technologies:

Using Python, Fastapi, Sqlite/Postgres with React Frontend, all dockerized and with logging (maybe sentry). ALso I'd like to run it in kubernetes as a learning experience.

CI/CD with Jenkins.
